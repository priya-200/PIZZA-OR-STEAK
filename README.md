# üçï Pizza vs Steak: Image Classification with TensorFlow üçñ

This project involves building an image classification model to classify images of either **Pizza** or **Steak** using **TensorFlow**. The project demonstrates both a **custom CNN model** and the use of **TensorFlow Hub pre-trained models** for efficient transfer learning.

## üß† Model Overview  
1. **Custom CNN Model**:  
   - The custom model uses a series of convolutional layers, activation functions (ReLU), and pooling layers to extract features from images.
   - A fully connected layer followed by a softmax layer for classification into either pizza or steak.

2. **Transfer Learning with TensorFlow Hub**:  
   - The pre-trained models are loaded from TensorFlow Hub and fine-tuned on the pizza vs steak dataset.
   - This method allows for leveraging the knowledge from large image datasets, speeding up the training process and improving accuracy with less data.

3. **Model Evaluation**:  
   - The models are evaluated using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrix**.
   - **Loss** and **accuracy curves** are plotted for model performance tracking.

## üèÜ Results  
- **Accuracy**: The custom CNN model and TensorFlow Hub-based model show impressive classification accuracy on the test set.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct classifications.  
  - **Precision & Recall**: Evaluate the model's performance in terms of false positives and false negatives.  
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insights into misclassifications.

- **Comparison**: Results are compared between the custom model and TensorFlow Hub model to demonstrate the impact of transfer learning.
